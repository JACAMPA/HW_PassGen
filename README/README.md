README PassGen This is a randomized password generator, click button and choose your characters and a random password shall be assigned.

This one works through using prompts and arrays, strings, concats and math.random. to give the user a functional randomized password.

This one was pretty difficult for me. Through trial and errror did i finally get it to work. I know the assignment is late. But on due date it was not ready and I did not want to turn in it in before finishing. So I think i worked out all the bugs with it. Realizing how important typos are! Through reviewing class videos, youtube, gooogle and reviewing Javascript 03 did I finally get it functional.
